# Lightning_Talk_2017
This is the demo notebook for Lightning Talk *Text Classification With TensorFlow* in GDG Festival 2017 Beijing .

This talk wil talk about Text Classification roughly, which referenced and was inspired by [WildML](http://www.wildml.com/), which is a very very good AI Tech blog. 

I will try to use ipython notebook to help the beginners like me to start quickly.
